# Mind Wave Control Robot

In this project you will control a robot using your mind.
The technoligies used in this project are Embedded System and Electroencephalography.

# Pre-Requisites:
    1)Arduino Uno ATmega328P
    2)NeuroSky EEG Headset
    3)L293 motor driver
    4)HC-05 Bluetooth Module
    5)Arduino Software IDE

We divided our project to many tasks to reach the final proto type :

    The first task was dealing with the interface of the brain signals
   	(Alpha- beta- gamma- theta-ratio of attention and mediation).
    
    The second task was building the robotic car and we make a small test
    to control it by a simple program in arduino to move and take a delay
    and move to the right and take a delay and move to the left then take
    a delay to move again to forward .
    
    The third task was connecting the Bluetooth module in the arduino to 
    control it wireless.
    
    The fourth task was about a small program by the C# to control the robot
    by form of the direction as the keyboard and the controlling was full wireless.
    
    The final task was to interface the EEG headset to the ardiuno robo inorder to
    control the robo using brain signals.

Inorder to interface the EEG headset with the Micro controller(ATmega328P)
Dowload the source code provided in the repository. 
Copy it to the Arduino IDE and in tools select the boards in boards manager select
ATmega328P and dump the code into the ATmega328P micro controller.
