We divide our project to many tasks to reach the final proto type :

 The first task was dealing with the interface of the brain signals (Alpha- beta- gamma- theta-ratio of
attention and mediation).
 The second task was building the robotic car and we make a small test to control it by
a simple program in arduino to move and take a delay and move to the
right and take a delay and move to the left then take a delay to move again to
forward .
 The fourth task was connecting the Bluetooth module in the arduino to control it
wireless.
 The fifth task was about a small program by the C# to control the robot by form of
the direction as the keyboard and the controlling was full wireless.
 The final task was to interface the EEG headset to the ardiuno robo inorder to control the 
robo using brain signals.
